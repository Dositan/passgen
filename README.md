A simple password generator that supports flags feature.

# How to use?
It's very simple. Run the main file by doing `python main.py`.
To be familiar with flags add `-h` at the end, this displays you useful information.<br/>
So, as example let's do `python main.py -n -uc -sc`. This includes all features the project has:
